First Simulation 
Setting: Deterministic = 0 (Random), Beta = 0, Nsimulation = 250, Nrow = 34, Ncol = 34, Nsample = 100, rangeE = ( 0.000001, 6, 13), rangeR = ( 0.000001, 6, 13)

Type 1 error: 
The rate of type 1 error is inflated when autocorrelation is present in both variables, Basically the rate is highest when rangeE = 13 and rangeR = 13. If one of the autocorrelations or ranges is not present, the rate of error is low. Random, systematic, stratified sampling shows this trend but vertical, and two vertical samling methods did not show this trend. I am guessing it is because of the small sampling size of 34/2. Dutilleul modified t-test successfully corrected the rate of type 1 error with all the sampling methods.
